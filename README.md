# jibri-pjsua

In this repository are all the necessary configuration files to configure Jibri (the recording component of Jitsi Meet) as a SIP gateway capable of making calls to other SIP devices with video and audio. Here are also the configuration files for setting up PJSUA, a SIP client that works in conjunction with Jibri to deliver media. Whereas Jibri comes with a virtual display already set up, it must be configured manually for PJSUA, create a server serving a registry of call-able users and extend the functionality of google-chrome, which Jibri uses to join meetings.
